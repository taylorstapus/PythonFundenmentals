Text Based Game: 
  This game highlights creativity by emersing a user into a campus of a school. The goal is to         collect all of the items before facing the final boss in the last room.
  The code utilizes basic functions of python including how user input is captured and process as       well as implementing decision-making paths to improve branching logic.
  The beginning starts with defining a basic structure for the game, adding an introduction to the enviornment and rules to encourage users to enter their first move.
  The next part expands on the types of choice the user makes. Utilizing if else and while loop statements and making sure there is a direction if an incorrect error is made.
  The hardest part of this code was creating the inventory system.
